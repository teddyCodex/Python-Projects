# BLACKJACK

## Objective:

    The objective of the game is to beat the dealer's hand without exceeding a total of 21 points.

## Global Rules

    Cards: The game is played with one or more decks of standard playing cards, without the jokers. Each card is assigned a point value as follows:

    Ace can count as 1 or 11 points
    Face cards (King, Queen, and Jack) count as 10 points
    All other cards count as their face value

## Game Play:

    The game begins with the player placing a bet on the table.

    The dealer deals two cards to each player, face up, and two cards to themselves, one face up and one face down.

    The player can then choose to either "hit" and receive another card, or "stand" and keep their current total.
    The player can continue to hit until they reach a total of 21 or exceed it, which is called "busting" and they lose the game.

    Once all players have finished their turns, the dealer reveals their face-down card.
    If the dealer has a total of 16 or less, they must hit until they reach a total of 17 or higher.
    If the dealer busts, all remaining players win. If the dealer does not bust, their total is compared to each player's total, and the player with a higher total wins.
    If the dealer and a player have the same total, it is a push, and the player's bet is returned.

    If the player's first two cards are a "Blackjack," which is an Ace and a 10-point card, the player wins immediately and is paid out 1.5 times their bet. If the dealer also has a Blackjack, the game is a push.

## Additional rules:

    "Split" can be chosen if a player has two cards of the same value, and the player can split their hand into two separate hands, each with its own bet.
    The player then plays each hand separately.

    "Double down" allows a player to double their bet and receive one more card.
    The player must stand after receiving the card.
